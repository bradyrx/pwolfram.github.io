# adding references
References can be added to the bibtex bibliography location listed in
`_config.yml`.  References can be cited in text via their tag, e.g., `ref1`,
via `@ref1`.

# changing reference types
Reference types use CSL standards, where common files can be found via
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/styles) and then linked via
the `csl` field in `_config.yml`.
