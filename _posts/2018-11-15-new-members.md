I warmly welcome Steven Brus and Zhendong Cao who have started working with me as postdocs to develop coastal modeling capabilities in [MPAS-O](http://mpas-dev.github.io/ocean/ocean.html) and [E3SM](https://e3sm.org/)!  Please read more about their interests on the [People page]({{ site.url }}/people).
