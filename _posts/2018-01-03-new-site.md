title: New site construction
---

This new site is a compilation of several technologies, starting with the
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) template.  [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
support is enabled to provide references and figure captions via
[pandoc-fignos](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos).

## Hyde

[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [\@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

## Jekyll

This is my new site built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool that can be used to produce clean webpages easily.

## Publishing
[Full instructions](https://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-plugins-github/), simplified below:

### Initial setup
1. In root directory for site folder, make a copied folder, e.g., `cp -r pwolfram.github.io compiled_site`
2. `cd compiled_site`
3. Clean it up: `rm -r *; git rm -r * -f`
4. `touch .nojekyll`
5. `git add .nojekyll`
6. `git add --all :/`
7. `git commit -m "Built site locally"`
8. `git push origin master:master`

Note, this doesn't keep a copy of the source in the repo!

### Automating the full process

Make a `Rakefile`:
```rake
GH_PAGES_DIR = "compiled_site"

desc "Build Jekyll site and copy files"
task :build do
system "jekyll build"
system "rm -r ../#{GH_PAGES_DIR}/*" unless Dir['../#{GH_PAGES_DIR}/*'].empty?
system "cp -r _site/* ../#{GH_PAGES_DIR}/"
end
```
Ensure that `exclude: [Rakefile]` is appended to `_config.yml`.

Can use the following script to automate pushing of the site:

```bash
rake build

cd ../compiled_site
git add --all
git commit -m "Published `date`"
git push origin master:master
```
